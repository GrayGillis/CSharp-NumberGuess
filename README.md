# CSharp-NumberGuess

This is an interface developed in C#. The user inputs their lower and upper limits numbers for the range. Then they try to guess the random number that is generated from the user inputted range. After each time the user makes an attempt the program will output: The answer is correct, The answer is Too Big, or The answer is Too Small. This will let the user know where to make their next guess. The program will also let the user know how many attempts they have done to find the correct answer.
